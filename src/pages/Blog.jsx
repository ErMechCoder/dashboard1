      <h4 className="text-bold text-center mt-3 ">What is Artwork?</h4>
      <p>
        The answer to this question is different for everyone. Why? Beauty is in
        the eye of the beholder. I respect the various mediums and platforms
        used to create artistic expression. Tradition has stated, those mediums
        are perceived through vibration of the ear and sight. Meaning, most
        forms of are deal with your eyes and ears. Historically, this was an in
        person experience until such time we we able to physically capture the
        experience to share with others. It started with recording voices and
        film photography.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward through the digitization of art through music and photo
        storage to complete animation. Now we're in an environment where many of
        the most famous artist of our time are not explicitly named but their
        products are used by millions every day. The gaming industry has curated
        an amazing digital production space designed to entertain and provoke
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the NFT offers us yet another space to play, grow business and
        develop community. This crypto currency investment is rooted in
        provenance of digital artwork. Which is a very traditional concept but
        the NFT allows for immutable transactional record vs 'take my word for
        it'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NFTs, digital representation of artwork and/or real estate where
        artwork can be displayed, can be bought and sold via various platforms
        and with various crypto currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do investors think about NFTs long term? Generally speaking, the
        most valuable NFTs will have some sort of utility. Which is why most of
        the high value NFTs investments have some sort of community around them.
        Exclusive experiences, relationships, real world =and/or digital
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p className="">How will the traditional art world be impacted?</p>
      <p>
        Individual Art galleries traditionally represent a small number of
        artists and showcase their physical art in physical places. The
        advancement of technology has scaled this a bit for Galleries. The use
        of ecommerce enables marketing globally for more artists with less
        overhead associated with the cost of operating a physical gallery.
        However, consumer preferences for high value products are still geared
        towards being able to see the artwork before purchasing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NFT takes this digital evolution to a new level by generating
        centralized hubs to shop for and sell digital representations of artwork
        with a new wave of currencies and a utility traditional art galleries
        did not explicitly provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is digital representation more valuable than owning physical art? Again,
        the answer to this question will be different for us all. Consumer
        preferences may differ depending any number or demographic indicators.
        Yet, here are the facts we see in the market right now.
      </p>
      <p>Cost of Owning Digitally is less than Owning Physical</p>
      <ul
        className=" list-styling-none"
        style={{ listStyle: "none", fontWeight: "bold" }}
      >
        <li>1. Storage Cost</li>
        <li>2. Maintenance Cost</li>
        <li>3. Cost of Shipping upon Sale</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Scope of Viewing capacity is greater for less well known works in the
        digital space.

      <p>Travel to see mona lisa vs experiencing it digitally</p>
      <p>
        Digital representation of Apparel for companies like Nike are retailing
        at a higher price than the physical counterparts are going for resale
        i.e. Jordan Shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing like holding the real thing or hearing the vibration
        straight from the string vs through a speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital artwork depends on a screen. If you're not into that or you
        don't trust the stability of the system over the course of time, all
        digital information could be lost. This is exactly why I recommend you
        invest in both physical artwork and NFTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As NFts get more popular, the original artwork will likely be highly
        positively correlated with the digital asset and vic versa. Up to date,
        the only indication there would be a highly negative correlation between
        the two (Original and NFT) is: you guessed it, starkly polar opposite
        demographic preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming the majority of NFT demand will be driven by 40- year old
        crypto owners, their preferences may have absolutely nothing to do with
        MONA LISA. Yes, I'm suggesting historically significant art in coveted
        museums can go obsolete, just as desktop computers. While, my previously
        stated assumptions directionally correct, they are wrong. Why? Because
        the SECs involvement in Crypto currencies make them fair game for
        institutional investors. Who knows how they will play in the alternative
        and ETF portfolio environments.
      </p>

        Raise your hand if you would be interested in managing a $100T crypto
        portfolio. ME ME! If you didn't know, it's still all about Bitcoin.
